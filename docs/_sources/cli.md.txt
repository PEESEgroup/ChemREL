# CLI Reference

The following reference provides documentation for all commands, options, and arguments available via the ChemREL Command Line Interface (CLI).

```{note}
For ease of use, the ChemREL CLI expects all input config and data files to conform to Spacy's data formats. For this purpose,
it is recommended that you use [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) to generate your dataset files, as Prodigy uses these data formats
by default.

To learn more about Spacy's data formats, view the corresponding page in Spacy's documentation [here](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats).
