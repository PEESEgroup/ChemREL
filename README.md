# ChemREL

Automate and transfer chemical data extraction using span categorization and relation extraction models.

## Introduction

ChemREL is a PyPI (pip) package that allows you to train chemical data extraction models with ease using a suite of models,
configurations, and data processing methods. ChemREL consists of a command line interface (CLI) through which you can
run various commands, as well as a collection of different functions that you can import into your own code.

When utilizing or sharing the dataset and models included with ChemREL, kindly note that they are governed under the CC BY NC 4.0 license as imposed
by software and data mining guidelines, permitting only non-commercial applications. They should be used exclusively for research.
